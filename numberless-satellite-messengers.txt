(For Entertainment Purposes Only; Not Suitable for Emergency or Vital Communications)

The simplest solution, without incurring expenses for equipment or software, would be to hire a secretary who can send you only the messages you need.
However, this solution may not be available 24/7 and might not meet your requirements.

Since the telephone network relies on telephone numbers for addressing, whether you like it or not, some form of number, even if temporary, is required for the two-way "numberless" SMS messenger to function.

Here's how two-way "numberless" satellite messengers operate:

Suppose you find yourself stuck somewhere in the Baltic Sea while traveling from Sweden to a party with friends in Finland...

You compose an SMS ($1) from your "numberless" messenger to your wife (+4611111111): "Everything is fine, but I'm running late. Lars"
She receives a text message from an unknown number (+46111122222) and responds:
... after 5 minutes ...
SMS ($2): "Okay, Lars, but contact Jukka, everyone is quite worried about your whereabouts. He's unable to reach you via the number +46111122222 something seems amiss."

Then, you send an SMS ($3) to Jukka (+3581111111111): "All is well, I'm stuck but on my way, don't worry, I'll be there shortly. Lars"
Jukka receives this message from an unknown number (+3585551112222) and replies:
($3) "Lars? Where are you? Why a Finnish phone number? Have you already arrived? Have you lost your phone?"
($4) "When are you planning to arrive? Everyone's eagerly awaiting your arrival!"
($5) "What's going on?"
($6) "No one can reach you on this number, not even your wife! Only I can."
... after 5 minutes ...
($7) "Why the silence? Are you ignoring me? What's happening? And call your wife!"
... after 5 minutes ...
Your wife sends an SMS from +4611111111 to +46111122222:
($8) "Jukka just called me. He mentioned you have a new number, he located you on +3585551112222, but I'm unable to reach you on it. Are you already in Finland?!"

As you can see, things can get a bit tricky when people aren't familiar with the underlying mechanics :)

Of course, your wife will likely understand how it works, and satellite messages often come with their own set of specifics, which can add additional context to the message.
This is just an illustrative example.

So, let's break it down. It doesn't operate like DHCP, but rather akin to how NAT functions in your home router. For the sake of simplicity, we'll gloss over some details.

Your computer, residing on a private network (your messenger in a private SAT network), sends requests (SMS) to a public server (to phone number B).
The router (your SAT provider) then reserves a random port (a random phone number A) on the WAN interface (within the public phone network) for your exclusive communication.
Any data sent to this reserved port (phone number A) by the public server (phone number B) is received by your computer (SAT messenger).
And naturally, such an entry into the router's (provider's) memory comes with a TTL(*4).

The foundational principles of both the telephone network and the computer network aren't all that dissimilar. Take a look at this:
ftp://100.100.100.100:2021 (port forward to a PC in a private network)
tel: +100-100-100-100 ext 2021 (You can access 2021 ext in private network via public number)
These concepts are easily grasped and familiar: protocol, public address, port (or extension in the private network).

While many might not find it challenging to deal with "ext" in their contacts, a contact formatted as 
sms: +100-100-100-100 ext "my satellite communicator"
would certainly be an outlier. To simplify matters, "ext" can often be omitted. In the telephone network, call distribution is managed by a PBX (or its equivalent).
By tweaking the configuration, you can easily drop the "ext." For instance, voice calls (tel:) could be directed straight to internal number 2021,
while a fax (fax:) might be routed to number 2022. However, SMS delivery is handled by your provider's SMSC (*1), which, naturally, isn't under your control.
You can't alter its configuration to redirect your SMS where it needs to go. 
But fret not, we can still get it to do what we need by communicating with it in a language it understands.

Now, let's consider a scenario where your PC resides within a typical SOHO network, and you're unable to administer the router. 
Say, for instance, you need to access it over the weekend from any internet address (perhaps on port 22 for SSH).

1) You approach the network administrator and request the reservation of a port on the WAN interface, along with the creation of a port forward to your computer. 
It's common to receive a rejection, and this is perfectly normal.

2) If you have control over a network gateway (such as your home router) with a public address X.X.X.X, you can resolve this matter independently.

3) Initiate a connection from your private network to your public address. 
The router will then allocate a port for you on the WAN interface (effectively fulfilling your initial request to the administrator, albeit temporarily).

4) Instruct your gateway to forward port X on your public interface X.X.X.X to this connection. Numerous tools can accomplish this, such as ssh -R (or VPN +...).
With the problem resolved, your PC becomes accessible from the entire internet via the public address X.X.X.X. 
(However, it's advisable not to proceed, as this could lead to complications.)

Let's consider running the "ssh -R" command over the telephone network :)

While you may not find a software tool specifically designed for this purpose, it's unnecessary. Simply follow the same steps outlined above, one by one.

1) Contact the provider of the messenger you're using and request the reservation of a personal phone number in the public phone network, which you can then assign to your messenger.
Expect rejection, as this is common.

2) If you possess an active SIM card (or use an internet-based SMS service) with a public phone number under your management, you can resolve this independently.
Ensure the SIM has an assigned phone number of your choice (from any country like UK, ES, PL, etc.) and at least one active service: SMS (In and Out).

3) Initiate a connection (send an SMS) from your messenger to your public phone number. Your SAT provider will then reserve a phone number for you (random)
in the public telephone network for your exclusive communication (essentially what you requested from the provider, albeit temporarily). 
Now you know this number - let's call it "X"

Now, onto the trickiest step:

1) "And instruct your gateway to forward port X on your public interface to this connection" - we need to redirect incoming SMS from our SIM number to number "X"
Here's a simple yet highly inadvisable (*0) solution that requires no additional software or hardware (warning: do not attempt this, as it could lead to trouble):

4.1) The SMSC (*1) is responsible for forwarding and delivering SMS messages, and unfortunately, we lack access to it. (No, we will not resort to hacking a server with SMSC settings.)

4.1.1) Reach out to your SMS service provider, the one whose SIM you're using, and request them to forward all SMS messages to number "X"
Be aware that this may not work if the SMSC retains the original sender number.
Anticipate rejection, as this is standard.

Another simple yet highly inadvisable (*0) solution (warning: do not attempt this, as it could lead to trouble):

4.2) Since altering the SMSC settings proved unsuccessful, we could attempt to mimic "SMSC" functions (receive, store, and forward) from our end. 
However, we would lose the original sender number, which is precisely what we need. 
The message would then be forwarded to the SMSC on our behalf and accepted by number "X" (ultimately delivered to our messenger).

Hardware: Any cell phone with the capability to insert your SIM card, equipped with an SMS forward function.
Software: If a suitable phone is unavailable, seek out a phone app. Most likely, any "SMS forwarder" app will suffice, that performs "Receive - Save - Forward" on our behalf to number "X"

If you've ignored my advice and managed to set up SMS forwarding, congratulations...
If it was a wager, consider yourself victorious.
However, swiftly deactivate the forward. 
Now, why are these approaches deemed "stupid"?

(*0) Yes, indeed, stupid. You've essentially allocated a public, dedicated phone number of your choice to your messenger. Anyone can now send SMS to you. 
Share this number with Jukka for testing, and he, along with all your other party guests (yes, all 50 of them), will likely put it to the test.
But here's the kicker: you foot the bill for both forwarding all SMS and delivering them to your messenger.
However, believe me, that's the least of your worries.

How did your friends realize they couldn't reach you?
Well, they received an error message, of course. And a single error message from your number "X" to your SIM number puts you in quite the bind.
When two robots are talking (M2M), one says "it cannot be delivered," and the second robot receives and sends this message back, creating an endless loop.
And guess who's footing the bill for their chatter? 
That's right, you are. 
This is an uncontrollable process: a "loop" in your cellular provider's network.

How many SMS messages can your "solution" handle? Perhaps 100-200 per minute? At a minimum, your account balance will be depleted in an instant, and your SIM card likely blocked. You may also face sanctions. 
And that's not all. 
If, due to someone's error, several thousand messages flood the channel you initiated to the satellite provider's network, after paying the bills, your wife may leave you...

4.3) Just another, better way.
You know how to create an "interface" for communicating with Your messenger from command line, but it does not lend itself to simple paths.
Opting for a responsible approach is crucial. Each message should be dispatched with absolute certainty, ensuring it's sent only once and not caught in a loop.

This assurance comes at a cost, but satellite networks can adeptly manage high loads without issue. For instance, sailors routinely transmit entire weather maps via satellite messages,
underscoring the vital nature of such communication, beyond mere amusement.

Should you require it, consider crafting your bespoke solution. Avoid mere SMSC emulation, instead, opt for a secure SMS Gateway.
While alternatives may exist, each harbors some form of defect, inevitably incurring costs.

Wishing you success!

(*1) SMSC (Short Message Service Center): The SMSC is a vital component of the mobile network, tasked with storing, forwarding, and delivering SMS messages. When a user initiates an SMS message, it first traverses to the SMSC, which subsequently forwards it to the recipient's mobile device.

(*2) SMS Gateway: Functioning as a crucial telecommunications network node, an SMS gateway facilitates the transmission and reception of SMS messages to and from telecommunications networks. It acts as a conduit between the mobile network and other networks, including the Internet or satellite network.

(*3) Sender ID Trust Issues: Public networks present inherent vulnerabilities regarding Sender ID integrity, as it can be easily manipulated.
Therefore, maintaining a confidential temporary number assigned by your provider, linked to your public SMS number akin to safeguarding your credit card,
is imperative. All traffic between these numbers incurs charges to your account, irrespective of message ownership. 
And if, for example, Jukka shares his adventures with your Finnish number, you may have problems,
since both the public and secret number are already in the public domain. Refer to Your provider's documentation to see how to block such link,
but sooner or later TTL will kill it automatically in any case.

(*4) TTL and Keep-Alive: As I am not affiliated with your provider, I cannot specify the TTL duration for your temporary number whether it spans days, weeks, months, or until the termination of your subscription. 
 But since we are using a two-way communicator, logically, while communication is taking place, it will not be interrupted. Naturally, if there is no traffic for a long time, the temporary number will stop working.
It is absolutely normal practice, if You go God knows where, where the phone does not work, to send Your loved ones at least one message a day.
"Everything is fine. I'm still alive" (Check-In preset SMS is free and unlimited with my subscription for example).
Incorporating your server's SMS number into the Check-In recipients list enables seamless tracking and contact. While my satellite provider offers global coverage, extreme scenarios like underwater or subterranean expeditions necessitate proactive measures. send yourself an Keep-Alive SMS from the server side daily, uptime or weather forecast and You will know that
everything is working. You are guaranteed to be left without communication with your server if any part of the equipment freezes or the power goes out.
Server message about critically low battery status and message at startup, save your nerves, but how many thousands will you pay for such
functionality if the server suddenly starts restarting every 5 minutes?.
I'm not saying anything about the loss of the Internet, it is absolutely not needed for SMS to work, however, for example, you definitely won't
receive a weather forecast without it. In any case, the check-in-confirm procedure should restart communication.
